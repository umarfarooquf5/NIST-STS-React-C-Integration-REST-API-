# **NIST STS React & C++ Integration (REST API)**
🚀 **A project integrating a React frontend with a C++ backend server for statistical randomness testing using NIST STS (Statistical Test Suite).**  

---

## 📌 **Project Overview**
This project provides a **web-based interface (React + Vite)** to interact with a **C++ backend server** that runs the **NIST Statistical Test Suite (STS)**. The system allows users to analyze randomness in data using various statistical tests.

### **Key Features**
- **Frontend (React + Vite)**
  - Modern UI for user interaction  
  - Live test results display  
  - Optimized for speed and performance  

- **Backend (C++ Server)**
  - Implements **NIST STS** randomness tests  
  - Handles incoming REST API requests from the frontend  
  - High-performance computation using C++  

- **Supported NIST Tests**
  - Frequency Test  
  - Block Frequency Test  
  - Runs Test  
  - Serial Test  
  - Universal Test  
  - Longest Run of Ones Test  
  - Random Excursions Test  
  - Approximate Entropy Test  
  - Cumulative Sums Test  
  - Rank Test  
  - Overlapping Templates Test  
  - Non-Overlapping Templates Test  
  - Linear Complexity Test  
  - Spectral DFT Test  
  - Differential FFT (DFFT) Test
